# FactoryPattern

I still need to finish implementing the NYStylePizzaStore and ChicagoStylePizzaStore.  I've added abstract Crust, Sauce, and Cheese classes.  I've also added an Enum for toppings.  There should be a way to have standard topping groups.  I'm also not really fond of duplicating **all** the pizza recipies for each implementation of PizzaStore.
